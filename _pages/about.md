I'm a Ph.D candidate at Texas A&M University in the Department of Computer Science and Enginieering. My Ph.D advisor is [Dr. Bobak Mortazavi](https://stmilab.github.io/). My research interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in time-series data. More specifically, my thesis focuses on meta-learning, transfer learning, and using them to build flexible models for heterogeneous time series biomedical data. Before Texas A&M University, I worked with [Dr. Diego Klabjan](https://dynresmanagement.com/index.html) at Northwestern University.
